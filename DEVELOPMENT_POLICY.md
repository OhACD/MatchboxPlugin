# Matchbox Development Policy

**Status**: Post-Rapid Iteration (as of v0.9.4)

As of **v0.9.4**, Matchbox has officially moved past the rapid feature iteration phase. The core gameplay loop is considered stable. Development going forward will prioritize **refinement**, **reliability**, and **production readiness** over rapid expansion.

## What This Means

### Stability First
- Updates will focus on bug fixes, polish, and consistency
- Large refactors or disruptive changes will be rare and intentional

### Controlled Feature Additions
- New gameplay mechanics will be introduced deliberately and only when they meaningfully improve the game
- Experimental or high-impact features will be clearly communicated

### No Surprise Breakage
- Existing configs, saves, and setups will remain compatible whenever possible
- Any unavoidable breaking changes will be clearly announced in advance

### Infrastructure & Admin Experience
- Tooling, spectator support, and server-side usability are first-class priorities
- The goal is to make Matchbox easy to run, configure, and scale on production servers

### Clear Communication
- Discord announcements will provide short, human-readable summaries
- Full technical changelogs will remain available in the repository and as attachments

## Path to 1.0

The remaining 0.9.x versions focus on polish, clarity, and cohesion.

**v1.0.0** will be the stability and consolidation release, ensuring all systems work together cleanly and reliably.
