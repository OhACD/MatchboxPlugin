# Matchbox Beta Testing - We Need You!

**Matchbox** - A recording-proof social deduction game for Minecraft is ready for beta testing!

## What is Matchbox?

Matchbox is a 7-player social deduction game where players work together to identify and eliminate the Spark (impostor) before it's too late. The twist? **Everything is recording-proof** - even if someone streams their screen, you can't tell who the Spark is!

### Key Features
- **Recording-Proof Design**: Identical inventories, paper-based abilities, hologram chat
- **Three Roles**: Spark (impostor), Medic (can save players), Innocent (detective)
- **Three Phases**: Swipe (3 min), Discussion (30 sec), Voting (15 sec)
- **Special Abilities**: Hunter Vision, Healing Touch, Healing Sight
- **Full Game Loop**: Multiple rounds until win condition

## We're Looking For Beta Testers

We need your help to:
- Test gameplay balance and timing
- Find bugs and edge cases
- Provide feedback on user experience
- Help us polish the game before v1.0 release

## What We Need From You

1. **Play the game** with 2-7 players
2. **Test all features** - roles, abilities, phases
3. **Report issues** - bugs, crashes, unexpected behavior
4. **Share feedback** - what works, what doesn't, what could be better
