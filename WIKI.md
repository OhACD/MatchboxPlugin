# Matchbox Wiki (repo)

This file is intended to be used as a starting point for the repository wiki.

Suggested wiki pages (copy these files into the wiki or use the docs below):
- Home / Overview — `docs/README.md`
- Getting Started — `docs/GettingStarted.md`
- Commands — `docs/Commands.md`
- Configuration — `docs/Configuration.md`
- API — `docs/API.md` (links to `MatchboxAPI_Docs.md`)
- Contributing — `docs/Contributing.md`
- Changelog — `CHANGELOG.md`

Notes:
- Keep the README minimal and link to the docs/wiki for details.
- Use the repository's `docs/` files as canonical sources; they are concise and suitable for wiki pages.
