# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing! A few quick guidelines:

- Run tests locally: `./gradlew test` (Windows: `gradlew.bat test`).
- Follow existing coding conventions and write tests for behavior changes.
- Open a PR against `main` with a clear description and changelog entry for non-trivial changes.

If you plan bigger changes, open an issue first to discuss design and scope. For questions, join the Discord.
