# Wiki pages (copy-paste-ready)

This folder contains Markdown files you can copy and paste directly into the GitHub repository wiki.

How to use
1. Open your repo → Wiki → New Page
2. Set the page title to the filename (e.g., "Getting Started")
3. Paste the contents of the corresponding file and Save
4. To set the wiki sidebar, create/edit the page named `_Sidebar` and paste `_Sidebar.md` content

Files:
- Home.md
- Getting-Started.md
- Commands.md
- Configuration.md
- API.md
- Contributing.md
- Changelog.md
- FAQ.md
- Developer-Notes.md
- Roadmap.md
- _Sidebar.md

If you want, I can also open a PR to add these files under `docs/` (already done) or try to create the wiki pages via the GitHub API — tell me which you prefer.
