## Matchbox Development Policy (Post–Rapid Iteration)  
  
As of **v0.9.4**, Matchbox has officially moved past the rapid feature iteration phase.  
  
The core gameplay loop is considered stable. Development going forward will prioritize **refinement**, **reliability**, and **production readiness** over rapid expansion.  
  
## What this means  
  
**Stability first**  
	•	Updates will focus on bug fixes, polish, and consistency.  
	•	Large refactors or disruptive changes will be rare and intentional.  
  
**Controlled feature additions**  
	•	New gameplay mechanics will be introduced deliberately and only when they meaningfully improve the game.  
	•	Experimental or high-impact features will be clearly communicated.  
  
**No surprise breakage**  
	•	Existing configs, saves, and setups will remain compatible whenever possible.  
	•	Any unavoidable breaking changes will be clearly announced in advance.  
  
**Infrastructure & admin experience**  
	•	Tooling, spectator support, and server-side usability are first-class priorities.  
	•	The goal is to make Matchbox easy to run, configure, and scale on production servers.  
  
**Clear communication**  
	•	Discord announcements will provide short, human-readable summaries.  
	•	Full technical changelogs will remain available in the repository and as attachments.  
  
## Path to 1.0  
  
The remaining 0.9.x versions focus on polish, clarity, and cohesion.  
**v1.0.0** will be the stability and consolidation release, **ensuring all systems work together cleanly and reliably**
