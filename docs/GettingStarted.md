# Getting Started

Quick steps to get Matchbox running on your server:

1. Download the plugin jar (e.g. `Matchbox.jar`) and a compatible `ProtocolLib` jar and put both into your server's `plugins/` folder.
2. Start or restart the server (Paper 1.21.10+, Java 21+ recommended).
3. On first run the plugin creates `plugins/Matchbox/config.yml` with sensible defaults (ready for the M4tchbox map).
4. Use `/matchbox start <name>` to create a new session and `/matchbox join <name>` to join.

Tips:
- Use `/matchbox setspawn` and `/matchbox setseat <number>` in-game to configure locations.
- If you want the plugin to use config defaults for spawns/seats, ensure `config.yml` is configured before creating sessions.
